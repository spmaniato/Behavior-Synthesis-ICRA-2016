# Behavior Synthesis paper

ICRA 2016 submission on the Synthesis of Executable State Machines for an ATLAS Humanoid Robot

Rough outline:
- Introduction
- Preliminaries (mostly LTL and synthesis)
- LTL formulas for ATLAS in the *activation-outcomes* and *activation-deactivation* paradigms
  - Also, preconditions, infinite-to-finite execution, and other DRC/ViGIR-inspired formulas
- Partial-to-full specification compilation
- Mapping between atomic propositions and behavior states (atomic controllers)
- Short description of ROS implementation (referencing behavior engine, FlexBE app, etc.)
- Post-DRC Experiments
