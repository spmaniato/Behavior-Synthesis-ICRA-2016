\subsection{Control Modes \& Actions}\label{S:CMActions}

We model Atlas' control mode interface (Fig. \ref{Fig:ControlModeTS}) as a transition system $(\mathcal{M}, \boldsymbol\rightarrow)$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of states, each corresponding to one control mode, $m \in \mathcal{M}$, and $\boldsymbol\rightarrow$ is a set of valid control mode transitions (subset of $\mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{M}$).
In addition, we define $Adj(m) = \{ m^\prime \in \mathcal{M} \; | \; (m, m^\prime) \in \; \boldsymbol\rightarrow \}$ and also allow self-transitions, i.e., $m \in Adj(m), \; \forall m \in \mathcal{M}$.

Furthermore, the system can perform actions. Actions, $a \in \mathcal{A}$, correspond to system capabilities $\mathcal{C}$ (other than control mode changes), e.g., generation of a footstep plan or closing the fingers.
Actions may also have one or more preconditions.
The preconditions of an action can be control modes or (the prior completion of) other actions, i.e., $Prec(a) \in 2^{(\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{M})}$ and $a \not \in Prec(a)$, $\forall a \in \mathcal{A}$.
\todo[inline, caption = {Our preconditions are kinda limited}]{We are not handling preconditions that refer to the state of the \emph{world}, e.g. ``object in hand". Instead, we precondition on (the completion of) actions, e.g., grasping the object, which is not as powerful in my opinion.}

\subsection{Atomic Propositions}\label{S:AP}

We adopt a paradigm that generalizes the one in \cite{Vasu2013ICRA}.
We abstract the actions, $a \in \mathcal{A}$, that Atlas can perform (activate) using one system proposition, $\pi_a$, per action and one environment proposition, $\pi_a^o$, per possible outcome of that action, $o \in Out(a)$.
Similarly,\footnote{The distinction between action and control mode propositions is purely for the sake of clarity of notation. There is nothing special about either.}
for each control mode, $m \in \mathcal{M}$, we also have an activation proposition $\pi_m$ and a number of outcome propositions $\pi_m^o$.
Therefore, the set of atomic propositions $AP$ is given by Eq. \eqref{ActOutAP}:

\begin{subequations}
	\label{ActOutAP}
	\begin{align}
		\mathcal{Y} &= \bigcup \limits_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi_a \cup \bigcup \limits_{m \in \mathcal{M}} \pi_m,\\
%		\mathcal{X}^\prime &= \mathcal{X} 
		\mathcal{X} &= 
		\bigcup \limits_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \bigcup \limits_{o \in Out(a)} \pi_a^o \cup \bigcup \limits_{m \in \mathcal{M}} \bigcup \limits_{o \in Out(m)} \pi_m^o,
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%where $\mathcal{X}$ are environment propositions other than outcome propositions, e.g., ones that abstract sensors, as per \cite{KGFP_TRO09}.
It is up to the system designer to decide which possible outcomes of activating a system capability should be modeled explicitly.
For the sake of simplicity of presentation, here we abstract all positive outcomes as ``completion" ($c$) and all negative outcomes as ``failure" ($f$). 
That is, $Out(y) = \{ c, f \}$, $\forall y \in \mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{M}$.
%For both actions and control mode transitions, the outcomes that are of most interest in the context of this paper are completion ($c$) and failure ($f$) of the action. That is, $Out(a) = Out(m) = \{ c, f \}$.

To conclude this section, we could say (somewhat informally) that the resulting discrete abstraction $\mathcal{D}$ consists of symbols ($m \in \mathcal{M}$, $a \in \mathcal{A}$, $\pi \in AP$) and relations between them (e.g., $\boldsymbol\rightarrow$, $Prec$, $Out$).
We defer a discussion of the mapping $\gamma: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ until Section \ref{S:synthesis}.
