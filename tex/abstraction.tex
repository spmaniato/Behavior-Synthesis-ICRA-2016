\subsection{Control Modes \& Actions}

We model \textsc{Atlas}' control mode interface (c.f. Fig. \ref{Fig:ControlModeTS}) as a transition system $(\mathcal{M}, \boldsymbol\rightarrow)$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of states, each corresponding to one control mode, $m \in \mathcal{M}$, and $\boldsymbol\rightarrow$ is a set of valid control mode transitions (subset of $\mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{M}$).
In addition, we define $Adj(m) = \{ m^\prime \in \mathcal{M} \; | \; (m, m^\prime) \in \; \boldsymbol\rightarrow \}$ and also allow self-transitions, i.e., $m \in Adj(m), \; \forall m \in \mathcal{M}$.

Furthermore, \textsc{Atlas} can perform actions. Each action, $a \in \mathcal{A}$, corresponds to an atomic capability of the system, e.g., generation of a footstep plan or closing the robot's fingers.
Actions may also have one or more preconditions.
Action preconditions can be control modes or other actions, i.e., $Prec(a) \in 2^{(\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{M})}$ (powerset), $a \not \in Prec(a)$, $\forall a \in \mathcal{A}$.
\todo[inline, caption = {What is the Discrete Abstraction exactly?}]{Are actions, preconditions, and the control mode TS part of the discrete abstraction or should they be defined in the Preliminaries instead? What is $\mathcal{D}$ mathematically?}
\todo[inline, caption = {Our preconditions are kinda limited}]{We are not handling preconditions that refer to the state of the \emph{world}, e.g. ``object in hand". Instead, we precondition on (the completion of) actions, e.g., grasping the object, which is not as powerful in my opinion.}

\subsection{Atomic Propositions}

\todo[inline, caption = {Define props in terms of FlexBE states?}]{Similar to question about $\mathcal{D}_M$. Define atomic propositions in terms of FlexBE states or primitive capabilities?}

We adopt a paradigm that generalizes the one in \cite{Vasu2013ICRA}.
We abstract the discrete actions, $a \in \mathcal{A}$, that \textsc{Atlas} can perform using one system proposition, $\pi_a$, per action and one environment proposition, $\pi_a^o$, per possible outcome of that action, $o \in Out(a)$.
Similarly,\footnote{The distinction between action and control mode propositions is purely for the sake of clarity of notation. There is nothing special about either.}
for each control mode, $m \in \mathcal{M}$, we have a system proposition $\pi_m$ and a number of outcome propositions $\pi_m^o$.
For both actions and control mode transitions, the outcomes that are of most interest in the context of this paper are completion ($c$) and failure ($f$) of the action. That is, $Out(a) = Out(m) = \{ c, f \}$
Therefore, the set of atomic propositions $AP$ is given by Eq. \eqref{ActOutAP}:

\begin{subequations}
	\label{ActOutAP}
	\begin{align}
		\mathcal{Y} &= \bigcup \limits_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \pi_a \bigcup \limits_{m \in \mathcal{M}} \pi_m,\\
		\mathcal{X}^\prime &= \mathcal{X} \bigcup \limits_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \bigcup \limits_{o \in Out(a)} \pi_a^o \bigcup \limits_{m \in \mathcal{M}} \bigcup \limits_{o \in Out(m)} \pi_m^o,
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathcal{X}$ are environment propositions other than outcome propositions, e.g., ones that abstract sensors, as per \cite{KGFP_TRO09}.

%\subsection{Discrete Mapping}
%
%\todo[inline, caption = {Level of detail in definition of $\mathcal{D}_M$}]{If we are going down the generic route, then this is not the right time to relate $\mathcal{D}_M$ to FlexBE. Remove subsection or talk in terms of primitive system capabilities.}
%The mapping $\mathcal{D}_M: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$ from Problem \ref{DiscreteAbstractionProblem} relates parametrized FlexBE state implementations with atomic propositions.
%Specifically, each activation proposition $\pi_p$ is mapped to the execution of a parametrized state implementation $\mathsf{s}_p$.
%In addition, each outcome proposition $\pi_p^o$ is mapped to an outcome $o \in Out(\mathsf{s})$ of the state implementation.
%In practice, an outcome proposition can correspond to multiple outcomes of the state implementation.
%For example, we may want to treat the outcomes $\mathtt{failed}$ and $\mathtt{aborted}$ of $\mathsf{s}_p$ as failure, thus mapping the proposition $\pi_p^f$ to both of them.
