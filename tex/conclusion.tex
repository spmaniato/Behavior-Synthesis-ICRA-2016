Trade-off between expressivity and automation (expert user manually vs automated but with hardcoded assumptions) \ldots

\ldots Once we have a synthesized SM, it can be treated as a primitive action with its outcomes, etc.

Comment on limited message size over bad comms? (send partial specification $\rightarrow$ compile and synthesize onboard)

Hint at the question: ``What does it mean to offer formal guarantees when the activation of primitives can result in failure?"

\ldots Future work: Capability specification, consider mutex for ``grounding conflicts", integrate more robots, \ldots
