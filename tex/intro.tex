\subsubsection*{Contributions (brain dump)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Partial to full specification
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Most intuitive from the user’s point-of-view
		\item Limited message size over bad comms (send partial specification $\rightarrow$ compile and synthesize onboard)
	\end{itemize}	
	\item Multi-paradigm specification (objectives and initial conditions from user, topology/modes, preconditions, task)
	\todo[inline, caption = {Consider mutex for grounding conflicts in this paper?}]{Also consider mutex for grounding conflicts?}
	\item Generalization of activation--completion paradigm \cite{Vasu2013ICRA}
	\item Integration with FlexBE and ROS
	\item Experimental validation on ATLAS
\end{itemize}
