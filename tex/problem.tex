\begin{myProblem}\label{DiscreteAbstractionProblem}
\textbf{(Discrete Abstraction):}
Given ATLAS' control mode transition constraints and the available actions $\mathcal{A}$, define a discrete abstraction $\mathcal{D}$ of the robot-plus-software system, $S$, that captures the execution and outcomes of the software implementation of control mode transitions and actions.
In addition, maintain a mapping, $\mathcal{D}_M : S \rightarrow \mathcal{AP}$, between the elements of the discrete abstraction and the corresponding software components.
\end{myProblem}
\todo[inline, caption = {Properties of mapping $\mathcal{D}_M$}]{In practice, the mapping $\mathcal{D}_M$ is one-to-many. But we can treat it as one-to-one to simplify the things for the paper.}
\todo[inline, caption = {Mention absence of workspace in $\mathcal{D}$}]{In general, we would have included the robot's workspace in $\mathcal{D}$. However, that was not necessary in the context of the DRC.}

\begin{myProblem}\label{SpecificationProblem}
\textbf{(Formal Task Specification):}
Given a task, in terms of goals $\mathcal{G}$, the task's initial conditions $\mathcal{I}$, and the discrete abstraction, $\mathcal{D}$, of the system $S$ that is to carry out the task, automatically compile a specification, $\mathcal{T}_S$, that encodes, in a formal language, the task being carried out by $S$.
\end{myProblem}

\begin{myProblem}\label{BehaviorSynthesisProblem}
\textbf{(Behavior Synthesis):}
Given a formal task specification, $\mathcal{T}_S$, and the mapping $\mathcal{D}_M$, automatically generate a software implementation of a discrete, high-level, control strategy that is verifiably guaranteed to satisfy $\mathcal{T}_S$.
\end{myProblem}
