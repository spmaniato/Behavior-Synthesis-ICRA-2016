We are motivated by three main considerations.
First, we want to formally specify the task to be carried out by our system in a way that also captures the possibility of failure and allows for the system's reaction to failure.
In addition, we want to allow non-expert users to create such formal specifications.
Finally, we want to automatically generate a mission plan that is verifiably-correct \ac{wrt} the formal specification, as well as its software implementation.
These considerations give rise to the following problem statements.

\begin{myProblem}\label{DiscreteAbstractionProblem}
\textbf{(Discrete Abstraction):}
Given Atlas' control mode transition constraints and the available actions $\mathcal{A}$, define a discrete abstraction $\mathcal{D}$ of the robot-plus-software system, $\mathcal{S}$, that captures the execution and outcomes of its primitive capabilities (control mode transitions and actions).
In addition, maintain a mapping, $\gamma: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$, which grounds\footnote{We refer the reader to \cite{Grounding2013} for a review of symbol grounding in robotics.}
 the abstract symbols of the discrete abstraction to the primitive capabilities of the system $\mathcal{S}$.
\end{myProblem}

\begin{myProblem}\label{SpecificationProblem}
\textbf{(Formal Task Specification):}
Given a task in terms of goals $\mathcal{G} = \{ g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n \}$, the task's initial conditions $\mathcal{I} = \{ i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_m \}$, and the discrete abstraction $\mathcal{D}$ of the system $\mathcal{S}$ that is to carry out the task,\footnote{In general, a discrete abstraction of the robot's workspace would also be an input to this problem. However, we are not modeling it explicitly here.}
 automatically generate a specification $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{S}$ that encodes, in a formal language, the task being carried out by $\mathcal{S}$.
\end{myProblem}

To illustrate these concepts, consider again the scenario in Example \ref{Ex:PickupObject}. 
We could say that the task's goals $\mathcal{G}$ are $\{ \mathtt{turn\_valve} \}$ and its initial conditions $\mathcal{I}$ are, e.g., $\{ \mathtt{stand} \}$.
The system $\mathcal{S}$ is Atlas running Team ViGIR's software, as described in Section \ref{S:TeamViGIR}.
Its primitive capabilities $\mathcal{C}$ include walking, rotating the wrist joint, and closing the fingers.
The system-specific constraints (e.g., action preconditions and  valid control mode changes) are encoded in $\mathcal{D}$.

\begin{myProblem}\label{BehaviorSynthesisProblem}
\textbf{(Behavior Synthesis):}
%\textbf{(Synthesis):}
Given a formal task specification $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{S}$, synthesize a reactive mission plan that is guaranteed to satisfy $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{S}$, if one exists.
Additionally, if such a plan exists, and given the mapping $\gamma$, automatically generate a software implementation of the reactive mission plan. 
\end{myProblem}
