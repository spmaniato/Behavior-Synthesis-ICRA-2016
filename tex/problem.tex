\begin{myProblem}\label{DiscreteAbstractionProblem}
\textbf{(Discrete Abstraction):}
Given Atlas' control mode transition constraints and the available actions $\mathcal{A}$, define a discrete abstraction $\mathcal{D}$ of the robot-plus-software system, $S$, that captures the execution and outcomes of the primitive capabilities (control mode transitions and actions).
In addition, maintain a mapping, $\mathcal{D}_M$, between the primitive capabilities of the system $\mathcal{S}$ and the corresponding elements of the discrete abstraction.
\end{myProblem}

\begin{myProblem}\label{SpecificationProblem}
\textbf{(Formal Task Specification):}
Given a task in terms of goals $\mathcal{G}$, the task's initial conditions $\mathcal{I}$, and the discrete abstraction $\mathcal{D}$ of the system $\mathcal{S}$ that is to carry out the task,\footnote{In general, a discrete abstraction of the robot's workspace would also be an input to this problem, but we are not modeling it explicitly here.}
 automatically generate a specification $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{S}$ that encodes, in a formal language, the task being carried out by $\mathcal{S}$.
\end{myProblem}

To illustrate these concepts, consider again the scenario in Example \ref{Ex:PickupObject}. 
We could say that the task's goals $\mathcal{G}$ are $\{ \mathtt{turn\_valve} \}$ and its initial conditions $\mathcal{I}$ are, e.g., $\{ \mathtt{stand} \}$.
The system $\mathcal{S}$ is ATLAS running Team ViGIR's software, as described in Section \ref{S:TeamViGIR}.

\begin{myProblem}\label{BehaviorSynthesisProblem}
\textbf{(Behavior Synthesis):}
Given a formal task specification, $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{S}$, and the mapping $\mathcal{D}_M$, automatically generate a software implementation of a discrete, high-level, control strategy that is verifiably guaranteed to satisfy $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{S}$.
